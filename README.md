# AI & Education: Impact Analysis of Student AI Usage

## Overview
This project analyzes survey responses from university students to explore the relationship between AI tool usage and academic performance, stress levels, and student involvement. Using statistical tests and data visualizations, we examine trends in AI adoption, challenges faced, and potential correlations with GPA and workload management.

## Data Description
The dataset consists of survey responses from students enrolled in **CS 105 & CS 111** at the University of California Riverside. The dataset includes variables related to:
- Academic performance (GPA, procrastination habits, course load)
- AI tool usage (types of AI tools, frequency of use, tasks completed)
- Stress levels (take-home work stress, test stress, academic workload)
- AI-related challenges (misinformation, ethical concerns, overreliance)
- Student involvement (extracurricular activities, clubs)

## Objectives
Our primary goal is to analyze the **impact of AI tool usage on student success and stress levels** by exploring:
1. **AI Usage & Stress Correlation**: Does using AI reduce or increase student stress levels?
2. **Class Standing & AI Challenges**: Do higher-grade students face more difficulties using AI?
3. **AI & Academic Success**: Is there a relationship between AI tool usage and GPA?

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We conducted a thorough **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, including:
- **Class Standing Distribution**: Examining AI usage across academic levels.
- **AI Tool Preference**: Identifying the most commonly used AI tools.
- **AI Challenges Analysis**: Understanding what obstacles students face.
- **Stress Analysis**: Visualizing stress levels in relation to AI usage.
- **GPA & AI Usage Correlation**: Investigating academic performance trends.
- **Extracurricular Engagement**: Evaluating how AI users manage involvement in student activities.

## Hypothesis Testing
We used **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** and **Chi-Squared Tests** to validate our hypotheses:

### **Hypothesis 1: AI Usage & Stress**
- **Chi-Squared Test**: AI usage **is associated** with stress on take-home work.
- **Pearson Correlation Test**: No strong correlation was found.

### **Hypothesis 2: Class Standing & AI Challenges**
- **Chi-Squared Test**: **Class standing is linked to AI-related challenges.**
- **Pearson Correlation Test**: Weak correlation.

### **Hypothesis 3: AI Usage & Academic Performance**
- **Pearson Correlation Test**: No significant relationship between AI usage and GPA.
- **Chi-Squared Test**: No strong evidence suggesting AI directly impacts academic performance.

## Key Findings
- **AI users experience similar or higher stress levels than non-users during exams** but report slightly **lower stress levels for take-home work.**
- **Upperclassmen face more AI-related challenges** than freshmen, likely due to increased coursework complexity.
- **AI usage does not strongly correlate with GPA,** suggesting students use AI for assistance rather than as a grade booster.

## Conclusion
Our study suggests that while AI tools are widely used, their impact on stress and academic performance is not straightforward. AI tools may provide support but do not directly influence grades. Future research with a larger dataset may yield more definitive conclusions.
